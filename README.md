# tracker
Here is my Tracker which I have started to code it around 2010. I often use it to track the papers and other research-related items. It is a primitive version of Mendeley, but there are unique feature that I rely on, particularly active folder concept. Current features by December 2022:

-Organize the papers automatically with the "active folders" concept 
-A systematic way to archive hundreds of papers and a cleaner desktop
-Group the related articles with search-based "active folders" automatically
-Record a meeting and take quick notes
-Extract a research webpage based on your keywords
-Write chronicles and ideas systematically in order not to forget them
-Do it with the minimum number of mouse clicks

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you face problems using Tracker or any suggestions. You need to register this MSCOMCTL.ocx file to Windows. To register the OCX file, please follow the description given in the following link (see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39251880/mscomctl-ocx-missing-windows-10). Please don't forget to run the command prompt as an administrator. The OCX problem is the most common issue for installing Tracker.
